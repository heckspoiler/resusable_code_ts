Eventually it boils down to inheritance vs. componsition. If things are unclear, go back to composition and rewatch.

##inheritance

inheritance is the case where there was an abscract class CsvFileReader and some child classes called MatchReader. 
CsvFileReader is the object that handles the reading of general csv files and we extended this class with the class MatchReader to make it more specific and customitzed more behaviour. 

##composition   

was charactarized by the class called MatchReader


the difference boils down to the "is a" or "has a" relationship between classes.

MatchReader is a child instance of CsvFileReader and in the case of composition we have a has a relationship. MatchReader had a reference to some other sideObject like CsvFileReader.
